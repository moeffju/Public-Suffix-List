= Public Suffix List

* http://github.com/toddsundsted/Public-Suffix-List

== Description

The Public Suffix List (http://publicsuffix.org/) is "a cross-vendor
initiative to provide an accurate list of domain name suffixes". Such
a list is necessary because "there was and remains no algorithmic
method of finding the highest level at which a domain may be
registered for a particular top-level domain (the policies differ with
each registry)...". Public Suffix List is also a small Ruby library
designed to make the Public Suffix List (http://publicsuffix.org/)
easier to use.

== Features

* Transparent download of the TLD data file
* Optional caching of parsed data
* Tiny API

== Synopsis

  require "public_suffix_list"

  # downloads and parses the latest data file and returns "com"
  PublicSuffixList.new.tld("foobar.com")

  # downloads and parses the latest data file and returns "foobar.com"
  PublicSuffixList.new.cdn("foobar.com")

  # downloads and parses the latest data file, caches it in /tmp, returns ["abc", "xyz", "co.uk"]
  PublicSuffixList.new(:cache_dir => "/tmp").split("abc.xyz.co.uk")

  # loads the cached data in /tmp and returns ["test", "nhs", "uk"]
  PublicSuffixList.new(:cache_dir => "/tmp").split("test.nhs.uk")

  # you don't have to instantiate PublicSuffixList every time you use it, of course...
  p = PublicSuffixList.new
  p.split("fee.fi.fo.com") # => ["fee.fi", "fo", "com"]
  p.cdn("fee.fi.fo.com")   # => "fo.com", "cdn" is "canonical domain name"
  p.tld("fee.fi.fo.com")   # => "com", "tld" is "top-level domain"

== Requirements

None that I am aware of.

== Install

  sudo gem install public-suffix-list
